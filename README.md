# Flappy Bird NEAT Project

I will be following the tutorial by Tech With Tim called [AI Plays Flappy Bird - NEAT Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2)

I'll be taking notes as it goes and keeping tab of my progress through it.  I'm excited to build something 
that I have played before and to create an AI that would actually solve it.  

Lets see if it works.
